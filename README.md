# Project Overview: 
Enhancing Marketing Strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd
This project is part of KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship through Forage (Hypothetical data is used for analysis)

# Project Objective:
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized organization specializing in bikes and cycling accessories, has engaged KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team to enhance its marketing strategy through data-driven insights. The primary objective of this project is to leverage analytics and modeling techniques to analyze customer and transaction data, identify potential customers, and optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing. This project is divided into three modules:

Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
In this module, we will assess the quality of the provided datasets: Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transactions data. The goal is to identify data quality issues and recommend strategies to overcome these issues, ensuring that the data is ready for analysis. A comprehensive report will be delivered to the client detailing the discrepancies and suggesting steps to prevent future hindrances in data analysis.

Module 2: Data Insights
This module involves gathering insights about potential customers by studying their past behavior and developing data analysis strategies. We will consider factors such as age distribution, the number of purchases in the last three years, job industry category, wealth segment, number of cars owned, and more. A PowerPoint presentation will be created to display the data analysis strategies and results, helping the client choose their target customers for optimized marketing efforts.

Module 3: Data Insights & Presentation
Please develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance).
